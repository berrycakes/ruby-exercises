# Activity 1 - In the right side we have given you an array and a number. Write a program that checks to see if the number appears in the array.
# arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
# num = 3

# if arr.include? num
#     puts true
# end

# Activity 2 - Write a program that takes a number from the user between 0 and 100 and reports back whether the number is between 0 and 50, 51 and 100, or above 100
# puts "Pick a number between 0 and 100"
# num = gets.to_i

# if num > 100
#      puts 'above 100'
# elsif num >= 51
#      puts 'between 51 and 100'
# elsif num >= 0
#     puts 'between 0 and 50'
# else
#     puts "Try again"
# end


# Activity 4 - Below we have given you an array and a number. Write a program that checks to see if the number is divisible by 2 and store them into a new array. 
# arr = [6, 3, 1, 8, 4, 2, 10, 65, 102]
# even = []

# arr.each do |num|
#     if num % 2 === 0
#         even.push(num)
#     end
# end
# puts even.class
